V1.0.0 [DEPRECIATED]
This is the very first version of the LB chip.

Components Used!
•	BC547-NPN
•	100uF capacitor
•	Resistor Legs
•	Proto Board
Version steps:
Uses the BC 547 as the brain of the LED flasher circuit. This chip uses the EMITTER and COLLECTOR legs of the BC547. 
For the timing, capacitors of various values were tested and the 100uF capacitor was chosen. 
Based on the reaction of the LED, it has been determined that the chip is working/blinking the LED at a frequency of 100blinks/sec
For the design and beauty, the chip is coated with melted rubber.

Total chip cost:
•	Chip without coating: $1
•	Chip with coating: $1.50
